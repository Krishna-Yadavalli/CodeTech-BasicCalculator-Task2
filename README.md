Calculator Program Documentation
Overview
The Calculator program is a simple console-based application that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
It prompts the user to select an operation and input two numbers, then displays the result of the chosen operation.

Program Structure
Main Class (Calculator):

The main class of the program, responsible for executing the calculator functionality.
It takes user input for the selected operation and two numbers.
Performs the selected arithmetic operation using a switch statement.
Displays the result of the operation.

User Input:

The program uses a Scanner object to read user input from the console.
The user selects an operation by entering a corresponding integer value.
Two numbers are entered for performing the selected operation.

Arithmetic Operations:

The program supports four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
It utilizes a switch statement to perform the selected operation based on the user's input.

Error Handling:

The program handles the scenario of division by zero by checking if the second number is zero before performing division.
If the second number is zero, it displays an error message indicating an arithmetic exception.

Functionality
Basic Operations:

Addition: Adds two numbers.
Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first.
Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.
Division: Divides the first number by the second (excluding division by zero).

User Interaction:

The program guides the user through the process of selecting an operation and entering numbers.
It validates user input to ensure it is within the expected range and format.

Result Display:

After performing the arithmetic operation, the program displays the result to the user.

Usage
Starting the Program:

Run the program, and it will display a list of available operations.

Entering Numbers:

Enter the first number and press Enter.
Enter the second number and press Enter.

Viewing the Result:

The program will calculate the result based on the selected operation and display it to the user.

Handling Errors:

If the user attempts to divide by zero, the program will display an error message.

Conclusion
The Calculator program provides a straightforward way to perform basic arithmetic calculations via the console. 
It offers essential functionality for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, while also incorporating error handling to prevent division by zero scenarios. 
This simple yet effective tool can be used for quick calculations and educational purposes.
